INTRODUCTION
------------

DamageCalc is a calculator made for the Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Black and White games to discover how much damage a certain move will deal against a pokemon. It's very lightweight and can be used during online battles.

INSTALLATION
------------

This software is made in JavaScript (using the jQuery library) and can be used from any browser that supports it. This version doesn't contain database information for pokemon attacks and stats. In my personal site you can find a version integrated with my Pokedex, which in turn possess enough information (base stats, types, etc) to create a better interface.

CHANGELOG
