INTRODUCTION
------------

DamageCalc is a calculator made for the Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Black and White games to discover how much damage a certain move will deal against a pokemon. It's very lightweight and can be used during online battles.

The damage formula considered is found in the Smogon University's site (www.smogon.com), together with a detailed description of all the necessary inputs. There are a lot of comments within the code (damagecalc.js), but you may find it better to understand the inner workings of the game before delving in the code.

INSTALLATION
------------

This software is made in JavaScript (using the jQuery library) and can be used from any browser that supports it. This version doesn't contain database information for pokemon attacks and stats. Someday, in my personal site you may find a version integrated with my Pokedex, which in turn possess enough information (base stats, types, etc) to create a better interface.

Any issue or trouble can be emailed to me at:

With subject "Pokemon Damage Calculator".
