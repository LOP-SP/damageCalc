INTRODUCTION
------------

DamageCalc is a calculator made for the Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Black and White games to discover how much damage a certain move will deal against a pokemon. It's very lightweight and can be used during online battles, just let a browser tab opened.

The damage formula considered is found in the Smogon University's site (www.smogon.com), together with a detailed description of all the necessary inputs. There are a lot of comments within the code (damagecalc.js), but you may find it better to understand the inner workings of the game before delving in the code.

USE
---

This software is made in JavaScript (with minor uses of the jQuery library) and can be used from any browser that supports it. This version doesn't contain database information for pokemon attacks and stats. Also, you can use this calculator in your own projects, according to the license in use (MIT License).
