damageCalc TO DO LIST

---> Must organize this mess...


__URGENT


- Redesign the calculator
-- Separate the modules into files
-- parsers.js? MVC?

==> updateStats must be transformed into a superParser method from battleModifiers

-- implement mod1, mod2 and mod3 calculations
-- integrate it into the damage formula

- What is the (current) best target for refactoring?

- Must create test suites with JsTestDriver asap!
-- parser functions first


__MEDIUM


- To do: Implement a way to calculate the probability that a move will OHKO (or 2HKO, 3HKO, etc) a certain pokemon
-- Must use all the possible values for the randomMultiplier variable, calculate the damage dealt with each of them and sum the probability of the multipliers that were sufficient to faint the opposite pokemon.

- create a more generic validator object for further reuse

- Criar funções para verificar dano total que levam em conta Hail/Sandstorm, Stealth Rock, Spikes (1, 2 e 3 layers), Leftovers, etc


__NOT IMPLEMENTED YET


- The item Metronome

- Moves implementation: Me First, 

- SNIPER NOT CONSIDERED
