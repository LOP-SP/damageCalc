damageCalc TO DO LIST

---> Must organize this mess...


__URGENT


- Redesign the calculator
-- Separate the modules into files
-- Create a namespace DAMAGECALC for all the files
-- MVC architecture?

- To do: Implement a way to calculate the probability that a move will OHKO (or 2HKO, 3HKO, etc) a certain pokemon
-- Must use all the possible values for the randomMultiplier variable, calculate the damage dealt with each of them and sum the probability of the multipliers that were sufficient to faint the opposite pokemon.

- What is the (current) best target for refactoring?

- Must create test suites with JsTestDriver asap!
-- parser functions first


__MEDIUM


- Criar funções para verificar dano total que levam em conta Hail/Sandstorm, Stealth Rock, Spikes (1, 2 e 3 layers), Leftovers, etc


__NOT IMPLEMENTED YET


- Metronome item

- Double battle moves won't be weakened... well, you can't select a move yet anyway. The isDoubleBattle flag is used for Reflect/LightScreen only

- Me First

- SNIPER NOT CONSIDERED
