damageCalc TO DO LIST

---> Must organize this mess...


__URGENT


Must update index.html, UI needs new parameters (refer to pokemonBattle.setPokemonStats to know what)

--> Create a third object in pokemonBattle that'll hold the battle's current state with the parameters for the damage formula

- add <label> tags to index.html


__MEDIUM


- To do: Implement a way to calculate the probability that a move will OHKO (or 2HKO, 3HKO, etc) a certain pokemon
-- Must use all the possible values for the randomMultiplier variable, calculate the damage dealt with each of them and sum the probability of the multipliers that were sufficient to faint the opposite pokemon.

- create a more generic validator object for further reuse

- Criar funções para verificar dano total que levam em conta Hail/Sandstorm, Stealth Rock, Spikes (1, 2 e 3 layers), Leftovers, etc


__NOT IMPLEMENTED YET


- The item Metronome

- Moves implementation: Me First, 

- SNIPER NOT CONSIDERED
